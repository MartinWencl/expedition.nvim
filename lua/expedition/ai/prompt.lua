You are part of expedition.nvim, a Neovim plugin for structured code exploration sessions.
An "expedition" is a focused exploration session with field notes anchored to code locations and a waypoint route (a DAG of tasks).
Help the user plan their exploration route, brainstorm ideas, and evaluate progress.]]

Based on the expedition notes and current state above, propose a route of waypoints (tasks) to explore.

Respond with JSON in this exact format:
```json
{
  "summary": "Brief summary of the proposed route",
  "waypoints": [
    {
      "title": "Short descriptive title",
      "description": "What to investigate or do",
      "reasoning": "Why this waypoint is needed based on the notes",
      "depends_on_titles": ["Title of dependency waypoint"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- Each waypoint should be a concrete, actionable step
- Use depends_on_titles to reference other proposed waypoints by their exact title
- Order from foundational tasks to higher-level ones
- Keep titles concise (under 60 chars)
- Base your proposals on the field notes and their code locations
- Do NOT propose waypoints that duplicate existing ones in the route]]

Rules:
- Only propose NEW waypoints (do not duplicate existing ones)
- Reference existing waypoints by title in depends_on_titles if needed
- Consider the log to understand recent activity
- Focus on what should come next given the current progress]]

Evaluate whether this expedition is ready to be completed ("summit reached").
Consider:
- Are all waypoints done or abandoned?
- Do the field notes suggest unresolved questions?
- Is there evidence of thorough exploration?

Respond with JSON in this exact format:
```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Explanation of the evaluation",
  "remaining": ["Any remaining items to address"]
}
```

Rules:
- "ready" is a boolean: true if the expedition can be considered complete
- "confidence" is a number between 0 and 1
- "remaining" is an array of strings describing unfinished items (empty if ready)
- Be honest — if there are open questions in the notes, flag them]]
